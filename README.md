# Hacktoberfest Activity Log

Hacktoberfest 2022 allows non-code contributions such as talks, blog posts and translations.

If you did a talk containing Catima, wrote a blog post or did some translating work, please make a merge request here to add what you did to this README.

## Rules
- Do not translate Catima using Google Translate. That creates more work for me, not less.
- Try to put some actual effort in your contribution. Contributions that are obviously just rushed to get a free Hacktoberfest shirt quickly are considered spam.

Breaking the rules WILL end in your PR being marked as spam. This could cause you to get disqualified from Hacktoberfest **forever**.
